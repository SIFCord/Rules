Please take the time to read and understand these rules!

**1. Be considerate of others**, there are actual people on the other side of the screen, so please no personal attacks, racial slurs, or derisive comments towards people's genders or sexualities.

**2. This is an English-only server**. Please keep discussions in English so as to avoid alienating other users and preventing apt moderation.

**3 . Do not insult other people’s preference in Love Live! Characters**. Saying you do not like a character is acceptable, while insulting others over their favorites is not.
-- By extension, this includes making jokes about a girl not existing, not knowing who she is, [x] belongs in trash, or 'N Girl' jokes, etc.

**4. This is a public server. That means keep things SFW, do not post sexual or violent depictions of the girls**. Remember that there may be younger users in the server, and you can find and share those things elsewhere on the internet. This rule also extends to usernames, avatars and emoji, and we reserve the right to change nicknames and ban emoji if we feel they are too inappropriate for the server.

**5. Don’t spam. This also goes for bots**. If it’s not relevant to the conversation, take it to <#313694608565731339>.

**6. Keep things legal. Please refrain from discussing illegal activities in this server**. This includes but is not limited to: selling/buying SIF accounts (or accounts on any other game), sharing download links to Love Live! (or other) albums/DVDs, and drug talk.

**7. No discussion of politics**. Please take political discussion elsewhere.

Breaking these rules may lead to a mute, kick, or ban depending on the severity of the action. Please keep in mind however, that everything is determined on a case-by-case basis, so severity of punishment may vary. 

If you notice someone acting up and/or being inappropriate, please message a mod. It’s what we’re here for, and you’re not bothering us by doing it.

Please note that certain user actions are logged for moderation purposes.

We hope you continue to enjoy Love Live! School Idol Festival.
